      "About ~8 years ago I worked for a company that made websites with older CSS frameworks. These sites varied from traveling agencies such as oad, petshops, and some smaller clients.",
      "While it has been a long time, I always remained involved to keep myself up to date with new technologies, learning them, and applying them in personal applications."
